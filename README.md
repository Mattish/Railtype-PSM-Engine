Railtype-PSM-Engine
===================

PSM 3D graphics engine aimed for vita


-------------------

This is a side project and currently not anything serious. Mainly wanting to look into what kind of performance can be achieved. The SDK on vita currently has /MASSIVE/ timetaken for gfx calls, so attempting to limit them as much as possible.

Currently aiming:
  Batch modelToWorld matrix calls for each entity to the shader in X amounts(100?). Need to check limits
  Vertex attribute for the matrix array position
