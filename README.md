Railtype-PSM-Engine
===================

PSM 3D graphics engine aimed for Vita using the PSM SDK

-------------------

This is a side project and currently not anything serious. Mainly wanting to look into what kind of performance can be achieved. The SDK on vita currently has /MASSIVE/ timesink for gfx calls, so attempting to limit them as much as possible.

master branch README.md for info.
